This repository contains solutions of different object oriented programming problems in C++. These tasks will definately improve your programming skills. To view problems and their solutions simple click on task.cpp files. In each task.cpp file there is a description of problem which is commented and below it its solution is provided. I would recommend you to first solve the questions and then see my solution.
